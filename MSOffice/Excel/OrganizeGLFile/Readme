I need to update my GL file with the proper formatting.

Attached is a comprehensive file containing all the necessary information. The task at hand involves linking Tab 2 (level 5) to Tab 1 (levels 1-4). This entails repeating each row of tab 1 to correspond with each output of level 5.

You can refer to the "Desired Output" tab to view the expected formatting for the first two rows of the first tab.

Looking to get this done as soon as possible.

Please do not apply if you wont be able to get this done tonight
