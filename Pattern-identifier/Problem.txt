I am looking for an AI software that can help me find keywords patterns from sentences. The AI will use a custom data source to find the keywords. I am open to suggestions on the ideal skills and experience for this job.

Purpose:
I want the software to find two or more keyword patterns and record the number of times it finds it within the data.

What is allowed:
This software is for personal use and you can build one from scratch or use an open source one just tweak it to my liking.

Language:
Python / Java

My Windows edition:
- Windows 11 home
- 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
- 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-1115G4 @ 3.00GHz 2.90 GHz
- 8.00 GB (7.65 GB usable)

Here is me explaining what I want it's only 3 minutes
