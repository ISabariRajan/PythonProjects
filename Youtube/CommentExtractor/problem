I am in need of a software that can extract YouTube comments from various videos for data extraction purposes. The software must be compatible with Windows operating systems and must output the extracted comments in Excel format.

What is allowed:
This software is for personal use and you can build one from scratch or use an open source one just tweak it to my liking.

Language:
Python
C++

My Windows edition:
- Windows 11 home
- 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
- 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-1115G4 @ 3.00GHz 2.90 GHz
- 8.00 GB (7.65 GB usable)

Here is me explaining what I want it's only 2 minutes
