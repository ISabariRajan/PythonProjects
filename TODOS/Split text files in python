
Split text files in python
Scripting & Automation
Posted 2 days ago
Worldwide
I’ve got several hundred text files with news articles from different companies over a multi-year period. Some files have hundreds of news articles in one long file.

What I need is for you to split each of those long text files into separate articles. Then, send me the python script you used to do this. This is a time saving thing for me, but I’d like to do it myself going forward.
