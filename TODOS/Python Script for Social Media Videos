Very trivial job. Just write a short python script that does the following:

1) User copies in a social media page with video content (For this case, it will be Tik Tok)
2) The script should be able to look at the top trending videos on Tik Tok (Or the page of videos the user specifies in the link)
3) The script will then strip those videos and download them to a specified local folder on the pc
4) Saves the channel name and metrics of the video in a text file in another local folder
