
Chart data in python from API calls
Scripting & Automation
Renewed 2 days ago
Worldwide
I have a number of charts I want created in python, calling data from various APIs.

If you apply this job, you MUST be very comfortable with python, working with APIs, data analysis, and data visualization.

An example of one of the charts I need created is a scatter plot of crypto protocols, whereby the x-axis represents 30-day change in token price for each protocol, and the y-axis represents the 30-day change in TVL (total value locked) for each protocol. You should also filter to remove any protocol which has less than $300,000 of TVL. The data is pulled from this API:  https://defillama.com/docs/api

I have numerous other charts similar to this that need to be created. This is just one example.

Although it's not required for this specific job, it's a PLUS if you can help me take the charts I like and publish them to a page on my website so the charts update automatically, therefore allowing me to view them on a daily basis. If you're not able to do that, it's okay. I can scope that out into a separate project and find someone else.
