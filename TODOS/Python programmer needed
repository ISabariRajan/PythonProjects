Scripting & Automation
Posted 5 days ago
Worldwide
I've half-built a website to sell digital products, i.e. interactive digital calendars, greeting cards, and digital magazines.

I need creative Ai or Python software to help me generate multiple digital products fast, and efficiently, and able to save numerous templates that can be edited multiple times without deleting the original work.  For example, I created an interactive digital calendar. Still, it's time-consuming to make and I have to use four different sites to complete one whole calendar, if I want to change the year of the calendar I have to recreate all the digital functions all over again, it's frustrating as I know it is possible to create one software that will help me design, make sections of the calendar interactive, adjustable and able to flip like a paperback calendar.
