Scripting & Automation

After updating my python API there is a problem making calls to duckduckgo. I used duckduckgo instead of google because there was no proxy for too many requests.

However, after updating, the DDG endpoint gets proxied if I make too many requests, so DDG returns a 403 error and doesn't give results. The one time I didn't get proxied, the response on render was never able to complete because it reached a timeout because execution was taking too long.

I need help fixing this issue. Please send me your availability and experience dealing with this problem.
