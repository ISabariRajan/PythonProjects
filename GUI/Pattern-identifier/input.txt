The novel begins with Madhav Jha, a young man from a small village in Bihar, getting admitted to St. Stephen's College in Delhi, one of the most prestigious colleges in India. Madhav is excited but also nervous, as he comes from a rural background and feels out of place among the wealthy and well-connected students at the college.
It is at St. Stephen's that Madhav meets Riya Somani, a beautiful and confident girl from Delhi. Despite their different backgrounds, they strike up a friendship, bonding over their love for basketball and their shared desire to make a difference in the world.
Madhav soon realizes that he has feelings for Riya and wants to be more than just friends. However, Riya is hesitant to commit to a romantic relationship, citing the differences in their social backgrounds as a major obstacle. She suggests that they become "half girlfriends" instead, a term that Madhav does not fully understand but agrees to nonetheless.
Despite not being in a committed relationship, Madhav and Riya spend a lot of time together. They attend parties, go on trips, and share their hopes and dreams with each other. Madhav introduces Riya to his friends and family back in Bihar, who are initially skeptical of her but eventually come to accept her as one of their own.
However, as the novel progresses, we see that Riya is hiding a painful secret from Madhav. She has a traumatic past that has left her emotionally scarred and unable to fully commit to a relationship. Madhav struggles to understand her and often feels frustrated with her lack of communication.
The strain on their relationship becomes more apparent when Riya starts to distance herself from Madhav and eventually disappears from his life without explanation. Madhav is devastated and heartbroken, unable to understand why Riya would suddenly cut off all contact with him.
He returns to his village and tries to move on with his life, but he can't stop thinking about Riya. Eventually, he decides to go to New York City, where he believes Riya is studying, and find out what happened to her.
What follows is a journey of self-discovery and personal growth for Madhav. He faces many challenges and obstacles along the way, but he never gives up on his search for Riya. Through his journey, he learns important life lessons about love, friendship, and the power of determination.
The novel ends on a bittersweet note, with Madhav finally finding Riya but realizing that their relationship may never be what he had hoped for. He comes to accept that sometimes, love is not enough, and that true happiness can only be found by pursuing one's own dreams and passions.
Overall, "Half Girlfriend" is a powerful and emotional story that explores the complexities of relationships in modern India. The novel is well-written and engaging, with well-developed characters and a compelling storyline that keeps the reader hooked until the very end.
